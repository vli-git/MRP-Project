# MRP-Project
Major Research Project 2020

The purpose of this project is to use an LDA topic model with LASSO regression to predict changes in trading volumes in the S&P500 index. The data used in this project is the larger version of the "All the News" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains news from various sources between January 2016 and April 2020.

#### Datasets
The datasets for cross-validation and testing are contained in the "Datasets" folder in compressed zip files.
To run the code, extract the folder within the zip file and change the filepath in the code accordingly
